# Self-publishing books with a self-publish app
A simplified eReader for your LaTeX authored books.

This was my crash test dummy subject while trailing in the
[Android Developer training](http://developer.android.com/training/) path. To cope with it, project scope was narrowed down to:

* Parse/render most common LaTeX elements for poem writing.
* Texts baked as application assets folder to simplify file read.

Not released for general public.
